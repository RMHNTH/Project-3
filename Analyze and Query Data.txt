-- Joining relevent tables
Step 1: join salaries table with employees table with key emp_no
        using JOIN.
STEP 2: join dept_emp table to salaries+employees table with key emp_no
        Using JOIN
Step 3: join departments to salaries+employees+dept_emp with key dept_no
        using JOIN 
Step 4: select every record from the joined tables
SELECT *
FROM salaries AS s 
JOIN employees AS e 
ON s.emp_no = e.emp_no
JOIN dept_emp AS de 
ON e.emp_no = de.emp_no
JOIN departments AS d 
ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no;
This query returns all have matching records in all the joined tables

-- Filter Current Salaries by Removing Historic Records
Step 1: select all records from salaries
Step 2: filter to_date by 9999-01-01
SELECT *
FROM salaries
WHERE to_date = '9999-01-01'
This query returns all the current salaries(WHERE to_date = 9999-01-01) and excludes
historic salaries

-- Calculating average salaries per department
Step 1: From the joined tables calculate average salaries with AVG function
Step 2: group the average salaries by department with GROUP BY function
(SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary,
       dept_name
FROM salaries AS s 
JOIN employees AS e 
ON s.emp_no = e.emp_no
JOIN dept_emp AS de 
ON e.emp_no = de.emp_no
JOIN departments AS d 
ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no
GROUP BY dept_name) AS q1
Returns average salaries per department

-- Current department manager salaries
Step 1: Join relevent tables
Step 2: Filter out historic salaries and focus on current salaries(WHERE salaries to_date = 9999-01-01)
Step 3: From the joined tables select salaries, names and department of the manager
(SELECT 
salary,
d.dept_name,
e.first_name,
e.last_name 
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN salaries s
ON e.emp_no=s.emp_no
INNER JOIN dept_manager dm
ON e.emp_no=dm.emp_no
LEFT JOIN departments d
ON d.dept_no=dm.dept_no
WHERE s.to_date='9999-01-01' AND dm.to_date = '9999-01-01') q2 
Returns all the records from salaries that matches the title of manager and current salaries

-- Create a view of average salaries per department and current salaries of manager in different department
Step 1: join q1 and q2 with INNER JOIN 
Step 2: Clean the results by removing quotation marks with REPLACE function
Step 3: Round off the calculated average salary to two decimal places with ROUND function
CREATE VIEW department_stats 
AS (
SELECT REPLACE(q1.dept_name,'"',"") as dept_name,
       ROUND(q1.avg_salary,2) as avg_salary,
       q2.first_name,
       q2.last_name,
       q2.salary 
FROM
(SELECT
d.dept_name,
AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM salaries s
LEFT JOIN employees e
ON s.emp_no=e.emp_no
LEFT JOIN dept_manager dm
ON dm.emp_no=e.emp_no
LEFT JOIN departments d
ON d.dept_no=dm.dept_no
WHERE s.to_date='9999-01-01'
GROUP BY d.dept_name) q1

INNER JOIN 
(SELECT 
salary,
d.dept_name,
e.first_name,
e.last_name 
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN salaries s
ON e.emp_no=s.emp_no
INNER JOIN dept_manager dm
ON e.emp_no=dm.emp_no
LEFT JOIN departments d
ON d.dept_no=dm.dept_no
WHERE s.to_date='9999-01-01' AND dm.to_date = '9999-01-01') q2
ON q1.dept_name=q2.dept_name);
This query returns average salaries per department and salaries of manager in different departments
